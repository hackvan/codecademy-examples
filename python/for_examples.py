'''
Multiple lists
It's also common to need to iterate over two lists at once. This is where the built-in zip function comes in handy.
zip will create pairs of elements when passed two lists, and will stop at the end of the shorter list.
zip can handle three or more lists as well!

'''
For / else
Just like with while, for loops may have an else associated with them.
In this case, the else statement is executed after the for, 
but only if the for ends normallyâ€”that is, not with a break.
